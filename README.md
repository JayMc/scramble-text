scramble-text jQuery plugin
===========================

Given a text string replaces characters until the mouse moves of the text revealing the real text.
Text can be scrambled in different ways: swap, shuffle, reverse, redact.

## Usage

```
<div class="words">the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</div>

<script>
$(".words").scramble({
		type: 'redact',
		redactChar: '!',
		words: ['dog', 'fox']
	})
</script>
```
Outputs:
__the quick brown xbo jumps over the lazy wbe__
Note: fox and dog are scrambled
When the user moves the mouse over the text it reveals: __the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog__

### type: 
- swap (default): swaps each character in the same position in hashmap
